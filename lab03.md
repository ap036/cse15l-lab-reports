## Lab Report 3

**Part 1:**

I chose a bug from ArrayTests as my example.

a) Failure-inducing input:
```
@Test 
	public void testReverseInPlace_1() {
    int[] input1 = { 1,2,3 };
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 3,2,1 }, input1);
	}
```

b) Successful input:
```
@Test 
	public void testReverseInPlace() {
    int[] input1 = { 3 };
    ArrayExamples.reverseInPlace(input1);
    assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 3 }, input1);
	}
```

c) Symptoms:

d) Code before fixing bug:
```
static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
    }
  }
```

   Code after fixing bug:
```
static void reverseInPlace(int[] arr) {
    int hold;
    for(int i = 0; i < (arr.length/2); i += 1) {
      hold = arr[i];
      arr[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
      arr[arr.length - i - 1] = hold;
    }
  }
```

For the reverseInPlace() method, it was returning the original inputted array, not the new array that should be used for the reversed version of the input. Hence, a variable was created to hold the current value at the index and change the parameters for the for loop to stop once i is less than half of arrayâ€™s length.

 
**Part 2:**

I chose to research command-line options for the `grep` command. The four different options I found were from this website: https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/grep.html 

a) -i (ignore-case)

Example with directory:

Example with file:

This option is useful when you want to find all the instances of a word regardless of capitalization. For example when searching for the word "Java" and you notice that in the various files and directories it is written as "Java" or "java". 

b) -v (invert-match)

Example with directory:

Example with file:

This option is useful when selecting all the non-matching lines. For example, if you search for "java" it will return everything other than all the instances of that word.

c) -r (recursive)

Example with directory:

Example with file:

This option is useful when you want to search for a specific pattern in an entire directory tree, as it recursives searches in each directory and all its subdirectories.

d) -H (with-file)

Example with directory:

Example with file:

This option prints out the filename first and then the lines in which the specific pattern is found. Useful when you want to move files or examine patterns in a larger scale.
